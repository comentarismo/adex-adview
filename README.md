# ADEX ADVIEW #

Ad view component that will run on an iframe and display/select/track an advertisement on the publisher side.

This will be hosted on the `adex.network` domain and will be easily embeddable in an `<iframe>` by referencing the HTML file and putting the bid ID in a query string param (`?bidId=`)
